# Crazy Cats Coffee Web Accessibility Project

Crazy Cats Coffee Web Accessibility Project facilitates developers learning and incorporating web accessibility (A11y) best practices into their daily workflow.

The core of the project is a set of articles with clearly outlined accessibility concepts. Each article is accompanied by an example code block and an example from the fictitious "Crazy Cats Coffee Shop".  

The project started as a single article with a codepen in 2023. It's now grown to a series of tech talks and a set of example applications.   To support assisting developers code for accessibility in their preferred languages, libraries and frameworks, a set of apps is being developed, each on its own subdomain, with a central site at https://crazycatscoffee.com.

The main site launched at the end of January, 2024, with the vanilla html and css example site in February, 2024.  This "hub and spoke" architecture keeps all the references connected while allowing developers to reference different stacks.  

Topics include: WCAG, WCAG2, AODA, ADA  Accessible language note:  The use of the word crazy is not ok when referring to people.  However, in this case we're talking about cats. Saying a cat is crazy refers to them running around having "the zoomies" and not to a cat with a mental illness.
